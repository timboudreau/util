        <h1>State Holders</h1>
        <p>
            Particularly when using lambdas, it is not unusual to have the
            problem of having a variable that needs to be final, but whose
            value can and should be altered inside a lambda, with no means of
            returning the altered value as the result of the lambda. 
        </p><p>
            For example, if you want to note for the caller whether an <code>IntUnaryOperator</code>
            <i>updated</i> an <code>AtomicInteger</code> or simply returned the old value,
            the code inside the lambda knows what it did, but since it must
            return <i>a</i> value, it cannot directly tell you - you could
            fetch its value <i>prior to</i> calling <code>updateAndGet(IntUnaryOperator)</code>,
            but now the code is no longer atomic - you just know the returned
            value is or isn't different from the value at some time in the
            past, not whether or not it is different <i>because of</i> the
            <code>IntUnaryOperator</code>.
        </p><p>
            <code>AtomicBits.settingNextClearBit(int start)</code> in the
            <b>bits</b> project is an example of exactly that situation - 
            we need to know the exact bit (if any) which was set on one
            long in an <code>AtomicLongArray</code>, and we have to know
            that it was this caller, not some other code running concurrently,
            that set this particular bit, or it will be possible for two threads
            to both appear to set the same bit simultaneously (and the entire
            purpose of AtomicBits is to avoid that situation without locks!).
            It is worth noting that if you want to use this pattern, you
            <i>must</i> reset the state of the state-holder upon entry, as
            atomics use a form of busy-wait to update, so the IntUnaryOperator
            may be called multiple times before it succeeds in updating the
            value under concurrent writes.
        </p><p>
            So, far from being a hack, there are some kinds of code that simply
            cannot be written any other way.  The typical pattern is to allocate
            an <code>int[1]</code> or similar, but this is both unappealing,
            and the allocated array may have more memory overhead than a
            single-int-field object.  <code>AtomicInteger</code> offers one
            alternative, but these also have more overhead than is needed in
            the case that the value is local to the calling method and cannot
            possibly encounter concurrency. To solve that problem, this package
            was born.
        </p>
        <h2>What's Here</h2>
        <p>
            Inituitively named classes that wrap a single-field primitive or
            object value.  To make it easy to switch between atomic and non-atomic
            implementations, most types have factory methods for both atomic
            and non-atomic versions - and <code>Flt</code>'s and <code>Dbl</code>'s
            atomic variants provide atomics not available from the JDK (wrapping
            an <code>AtomicInteger</code> and <code>AtomicLong</code> under the
            hood, thanks to <code>Double.doubleBitsToLong()</code> and similar
            methods).
