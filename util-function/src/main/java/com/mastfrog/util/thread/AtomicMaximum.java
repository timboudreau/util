/**
 * Non-blocking counter which tracks thread contention.  To use, wrap the
 * logic to be run in a Runnable and pass it to the run() method.  This object
 * can be queried for the current number of threads inside the run() method and
 * the historical maximum number of threads.  Calls to collect such statistics
 * and the run() method are non-blocking operations and this class uses
 * no locks.  It is useful for gathering data about thread contention and
 * possibly for self-tuning algorithms which determine thread-pool size.
 * <p/>
 * For convenience, this class extends Number.  The numeric value is the
 * maximum threads.
 * <p/>
 * This class may also be used to create an object representing the maximum
 * value of some number which may be atomically updated from multiple threads,
 * using the setMaximum method.  These two uses are orthagonal.
