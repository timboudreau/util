        <h1>Misc Functional Types</h1>
        <p>
            <code>java.util.function</code> does a good job of providing the
            basics for functional programming in Java; however, they are limited
            to the most obvious use cases - there is a LongConsumer and
            IntConsumer which avoid boxing overhead (which can make a 9x performance
            difference) - but there is no, say, ShortConsumer or ByteConsumer or
            DoubleBiConsumer.
        </p>
        <p>
            And while BiFunction, BiPredicate and BiConsumer are useful, if you
            want to make liberal use of method references to generalize methods
            on heterogenous types that take the same arguments to an interface,
            <i>without having to modify those classes' code</i>, you are likely
            to each of the above taking several more arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
            And when doing that, frequently you are dealing in code that can throw
            a checked exception - which quickly turns what would be clean, functional
            code into a spaghetti-like wasteland of try/catch blocks.  So this project
            also includes throwing variants of all of the JDK functional types and
            its own.
